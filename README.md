Tissue - Blender's add-on for computational design by Co-de-iT
http://www.co-de-it.com/wordpress/code/blender-tissue

Tissue is already shipped with both Blender 2.79b and Blender 2.80. However both versions can be updated manually, for more updated features and more stability.

### Blender 2.80

### Installation:

1. Start Blender. Open User Preferences, the addons tab

3. Click "install from file" and point Blender at the downloaded zip ("Install..." for Blender 2.80)

Tissue is free and open-source. I really think that this is the power of Blender and I wanted to give my small contribution to it.
If you like my work and you want to help to continue the development of Tissue, please consider to make a small donation. Any small contribution is really appreciated, thanks! :-D
