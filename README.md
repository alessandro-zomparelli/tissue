Tissue - Blender's add-on for computational design by Co-de-iT
https://www.co-de-it.com/code/blender-tissue

Tissue is already shipped with both Blender. However, I recommend updating the default version by downloading manually the most recent one, for more updated features and more stability.

### Blender 5

Download the latest release: https://github.com/alessandro-zomparelli/tissue/releases

### Installation:

1. Start Blender. Go to "Edit" and then "Preferences"
2. Open the "Add-ons" preferences
3. Click "install..." and point Blender at the downloaded zip file (on OSX it may have extracted the zip automatically, that won't work, so you have to zip the extracted folder again)
4. You may see now two different versions of Tissue, activate only the second one and ignore the first one

### Documentation

### Issues
Please help me keep Tissue stable and updated, report any issues or feedback here: https://github.com/alessandro-zomparelli/tissue/issues

### Contribute
Tissue is free and open-source. I think that this is the power of Blender and I wanted to give my small contribution to it.
